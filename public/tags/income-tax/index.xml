      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started filing my own taxes a few years ago by reading up online/watching YouTube videos.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coming from a non finance background, I spent a lot of time reading up to understand the different sections, deductions, etc. when I first filed my own taxes. I learnt a lot in the process and was exhilarated when the ITR went through without any issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a year and I had to file taxes again. To my surprise, I struggled to recollect majority of the things I&amp;rsquo;d learnt last time and had to go through the same process again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
