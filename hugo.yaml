    content: |-
      I am an experienced software engineer with 10+ years of experience, developing android apps while consistently exploring other technologies on the side. I am driven by the urge to solve problems and create lasting impact.

      An introvert at heart and an unapologetic sleepaholic, I find solace in my bed, books and in the worlds of TV shows, movies, and anime.

      As a dedicated foodie and avid traveler, I enthusiastically embrace all cuisines and look forward to exploring new places.
      
      I seek adrenaline rushes from debugging intricate/obscure problems at work and embarking on heart-pounding escapades like skydiving, bungee jumping, and scuba diving off hours.
