I started filing my own taxes a few years ago by reading up online/watching YouTube videos. 

Coming from a non finance background, I spent a lot of time reading up to understand the different sections, deductions, etc. when I first filed my own taxes. I learnt a lot in the process and was exhilarated when the ITR went through without any issues.

Fast forward a year and I had to file taxes again. To my surprise, I struggled to recollect majority of the things I'd learnt last time and had to go through the same process again.

This time, I decided to do my future self a favor by jotting down high level pointers that'd help me in filing
future tasks.

Now, that I've benefitted from this for multiple years, I thought why not put this out for others too.
